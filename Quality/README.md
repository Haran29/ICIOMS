Ice Cream Inventory and Order Management System (ICIOMS)

The proposed Ice Cream Inventory and Order Management System (ICIOMS) for the 
local ice cream factory introduces a user-friendly web-based dashboard for efficient 
order processing. The system, built on a robust database, ensures real-time inventory 
tracking, enabling seamless updates of stock quantities for proactive stock management. 
Basic automated email notifications enhance responsiveness to inventory needs. The 
system maintains a customer order history database for predicting popular flavors and 
personalized service
